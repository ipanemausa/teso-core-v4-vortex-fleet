# 🔄 HANDOVER PROTOCOL: REACTIVATION KEY
> **For:** Future AI Agents / Antigravity Instances
> **From:** The Operational Architect (Feb 2026)
> **Objective:** RESTORE CONTEXT IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT GUESS.

## 🛑 STOP & READ FIRST
If you are reading this, the user has reactivated the session.
**DO NOT start coding blindly.**
**DO NOT create new files without reading the Architecture Manifesto.**

## 1. CURRENT STATE (STATUS QUO)
*   **Architecture:** We are migrating from Monolith to **Modular Micro-Components**.
*   **The Big Win:** We successfully decoupled the Map (`LiveOpsMap.jsx`) from the Dashboard.
*   **The Rules:**
    *   NEVER add logic to `OperationalDashboard.jsx`. It is a View Container.
    *   NEVER mix Finance Excel logic with Leaflet Map logic in the same file.

## 2. CRITICAL DOCUMENTS (YOUR BRAIN)
Read these files immediately to upload the project context to your memory:
1.  `docs/TESO_AGENT_SYMPHONY.md` -> The Logic Flow (PhD Level).
2.  `docs/TESO_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_2026.md` -> The Roadmap.
3.  `docs/agent_manuals/*` -> The Personality of our Agents.

## 3. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (THE QUEUE)
The previous session ended with the **Dashboard fully stable**.
The next tasks in the Roadmap are:
1.  Isolate the `AnalyticsDashboard` (Finance) just like we did with the Map.
2.  Implement the "Event Bus" triggering logic described in the Symphony.
